this is a twitter and mastodon bot written in javascript
([typescript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/), actually) running on
[node.js](http://nodejs.org/).

you can run it on your computer or remix it into something new! you'll need node
and [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) (and git) installed. then run:
```
git clone https://github.com/lostfictions/heathbot
cd heathbot
yarn install
yarn dev
```

in a server environment, this bot can be run with
[docker](https://docs.docker.com/) for an easier time. (i recommend
[dokku](http://dokku.viewdocs.io/dokku/) if you're looking for a nice way to
develop and host bots.)

the bot needs environment variables if you want it to do stuff:

- `MASTODON_TOKEN`: a Mastodon user API token
- `MASTODON_SERVER`: the instance to which API calls should be made (usually
  where the bot user lives.) (default: https://mastodon.social)
- `TWITTER_CONSUMER_KEY`, `TWITTER_CONSUMER_SECRET`, `TWITTER_ACCESS_KEY`, and
  `TWITTER_ACCESS_SECRET`: you need all of these guys to make a tweet.
- `DATA_DIR`: the directory in which to search for cat parts and store data on
  which words have been used recently. (default: 'persist')
- `CRON_RULE`: the interval between each post, in crontab format. (default:
  every four hours)

heathbot uses the [envalid](https://github.com/af/envalid) package which in turn
wraps [dotenv](https://github.com/motdotla/dotenv), so you can alternately stick
any of the above environment variables in a file named `.env` in the project
root. (it's gitignored, so there's no risk of accidentally committing private
API tokens you put in there.)
